# Fucking algorithm

English translation is in progress... Some articles are still in Chinese, but most are completed. Please **star** this repo. The full translation will eventually be finished. Enjoy.

These articles go over different kinds of **Algorithmic Thinking**. All are based on LeetCode problems. They contain **not just the solution code for a problem, but also WHY the solution works and HOW you too can figure it out**.

I don't like one-liners. They can be confusing. I like clear, easily understandable code.

The **Gitbook** has been deployed and will sync with this branch of the repo: [https://labuladong.gitbook.io/algo-en/](https://labuladong.gitbook.io/algo-en/)

If you would like to clone this repo, please use following command:

```shell
git clone --depth 1  --branch english https://github.com/labuladong/fucking-algorithm.git
```

This command specifies the `english` branch and will limit the depth of the clone and get rid of the Git commit history, which can be faster to clone.
